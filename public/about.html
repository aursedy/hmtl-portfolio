<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Francis Aursedy Mpoungui Ngoyi. I'm 23 years old now and I was born in the Republic of Congo in 2000. 
  I come from a city near the sea named Pointe-Noire. I have spent 17 years there with my family and spent my entire 
  school there in french. I was really good at maths and I loved science so I decided to study science during my high shcool.
</p>

<p>But ever since I was a science guy I have always been attracted by the IT world. It's always fascinated me since I 
  was 14. Then after completed my high school in 2017, I decided to change my field and study computer science at university.
</p>

<p>In September 2017 I traveled to Czech Republic to study Computer science. I first spent one year learning czech language 
  in a small village called Podebrady. Then I spent four years studying IT in the university of Pardubice in czech where
  unfortunately I couldn't complete my study. Then in 2022 I started studying again Informatics in The Czech university of 
  life science where I'm currently studying hoping to finish it in one or two years.
